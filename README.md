# Next Spring

This is a simple game rental service API that I created using Spring Boot. The purpose of this project was to test my knowledge of this framework and to learn how to use its features. The API allows users to create, update, delete and search for games, as well as to rent and return them. It also handles authentication and authorization using JWT tokens. The API follows the RESTful principles and uses a PostgreSQL container as its database. I used Spring Boot Starter Web, Spring Boot Starter Data JPA, Spring Boot Starter Security and Spring Boot Starter Test as dependencies. I also used Lombok to reduce boilerplate code and Swagger to document the API. The project is available on GitHub and can be run using Maven or Docker.

#### PRESENTATION LAYER

This layer is at the top of the architecture. This tier is responsible for:

九덢잺 Performing authentication.

九덢잺 Converting JSON data into an object (and vice versa).

九덢잺 Handling HTTP requests.

九덢잺 Transfering authentication to the business layer.

#### BUSINESS LAYER

The business layer is responsible for:

九덢잺 Performing validation.

九덢잺 Performing authorization.

九덢잺 Handling the business logic and rules.

#### PERSISTENCE LAYER

This layer is responsible for:

九덢잺 Containing storage logic.

九덢잺 Fetching objects and translating them into database rows (and vice versa).

#### DATABASE LAYER

This layer is simply the actual database that is responsible for:

九덢잺 Performing database operations (mainly CRUD operations).

## Software structure

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Build the project using Maven:

```
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

4. Run the project using Maven wrapper:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

5. The application will start on http://localhost:8080

6. You can then test the API using Swagger UI or some HTTP client like curl or Postman

## Usage

- You will also need the database installed on your machine and set the connection vars on the application.properties or application.yml

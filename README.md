## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Build the project using Maven:

```
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

4. Run the project using Maven wrapper:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

5. The application will start on http://localhost:8000

## Usage

- You will also need the database installed on your machine and set the connection vars on the application.properties or application.yml
